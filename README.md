BookSystemProject
Welcome to the BookSystem wiki!
   BookSystem is a typical program for managing orders, customers and goods available for sale.
In this implementation, the goods can be borrowed for a specified period of time. 
One book can have multiple borrowings at a time. 
All rentals can be checked graphically in the calendar.
There are two types of users in the system:
- administrator - Administrator - can do anything
- employee - can do anything except managing other employees and removing clients
